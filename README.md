# IndPQ (Indexed Priority Queue) Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements an **Indexed Priority Queue (IndPQ)** in C++. The IndPQ allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and updating of priorities, commonly used in Dijkstra's Algorithm and other optimization problems.

## 🔧 Features
- Insertion of key-value pairs
- Efficient priority updating
- Removal of the minimum element
- Supports custom comparators

## 📂 File Structure
```
IndPQ/
├── IndPQ.cpp
├── IndPQ.h
├── main.cpp
└── README.md
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Bash Terminal

## ✅ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdhamMakar/Priority-Que-indPQ-.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Priority-Que-indPQ-
```

3. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ -o IndPQ main.cpp IndPQ.cpp
```

4. Run the executable:
```bash
./IndPQ
```

## 🛤️ Future Improvements
- Support for max-priority queue
- Optimization for large data sets
